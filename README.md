A simple page that uses [this](https://spacelaunchnow.me/api/3.3.0/) API (if too many requests are made in short period of time it gets throttled) to render upcoming 10 rocket launches.

As the goal was to keep it simple, the following compromises were made:
* No legacy browser support
* Was not tested for accessibility
* Has only crude error handling
* No pagination and work (loading) indicators added
* Very little styling
